NOTE: django-localeurl is currently un-maintained (so pull requests will not be
reviewed or merged), and its approach has been obsoleted by the introduction of
locale-aware URL patterns in Django itself
(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/i18n/translation/#module-django.conf.urls.i18n). If
you are nonetheless interested in taking over maintenance of django-localeurl,
please file an issue (https://bitbucket.org/carljm/django-localeurl/issues) to
volunteer. Thank you!

This Django application allows the language be set in the URL.
